Title of the Project: Community Co-creation of Collective Memory

Project leader: Mr. HUANG Zeyu (zhuangbi@connect.ust.hk)

Supervisor / Primary Investigator(s): Prof. MA Xiaojuan (mxj@cse.ust.hk)

## Voluntary Participation

Participation in this study is completely voluntary. You have the right to withdraw at any time without penalty. If you choose to withdraw from the study, you should inform the project leader, and upon confirmation, your data will be deleted and not included in the study.


## Data Collection & Confidentiality

### Personal identifiers

Personal identifiers (e.g., your name, email, WeChat/WhatsApp, Apple ID) will be collected in the entry survey. They will be separatedly stored from other data listed below. The personal indentifiers are only accessible by the researchers and will not be disclosed to any third party. We will only use this data to contact you whenever necessary.

### The content you created inside the app

The content you created inside the app ("the content") includes any text, recording, photos you upload and their derivations.
They will be stored securely at HKUST and will only be used for purposes of this study. The personal identifiers are removed from them (i.e., the content is anonymized). The content is accessible and only accessible by:
1. The researchers involved in this research project
2. Other participants of this study (only accessible through the app)

The results of this research may be presented at conferences or published in academic journals. For presentation purposes, a selected subset of the user-created content may be displayed to the public in academic papers as a part of the report. You agree that the researchers can add your content (fully anonymized or pseudonymized as per your chosen ID inside the app) to academic publications *without asking for your additional approval*.

For demostration purposes, a selected subset of the user-created content may be displayed to the public in other materials outside the academic publication venue, like demo videos/diagrams and advertisement of this research work. The researchers *will* obtain additional approval from the users before adding their content to such materials.

### "Other" data

"Other" data includes
* your demographic data (e.g., age, gender),
* your input from the entry survey questionnaire, the exit survey questionnaire, the interview (if opt in),
* the automatic logs of your app usage.

They will be stored securely at HKUST and will only be used for purposes of this study. The personal identifiers are stripped from them (i.e., the data is anonymized). The researchers involved in this research project will have access to them.

The results of this research may be presented at conferences or published in academic journals, but your identity and the data we collected from you will not be disclosed in any publication or presentation unless additional permission is acquired from you. You agree that the researchers can add your content (fully anonymized or pseudonymized as per your chosen ID inside the app) to academic publications *without asking for your additional approval*.


## Risk and Discomfort

Participants may experience unexpected harassment or offend if some other participants do not follow the rules and post inappropriate content on the platform. The current application, as a prototype and proof-of-concept, has very limited or no content moderation. However, the researchers have zero tolerance with inappropriate content, and will help mitigating the discomform by
* listen and respond to participants' report of inappropriate content idenitified in this application
* delete confirmed inappropriate content
* if necessary, disqualify the participant that posts the confirmed inappropriate content
* if participants appeal to the university for investigation, coorperate the university in investigating the inappropriate content
