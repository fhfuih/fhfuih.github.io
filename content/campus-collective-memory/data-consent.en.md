### Personal identifiers

Personal identifiers (e.g., your name, email, WeChat/WhatsApp, Apple ID) will be collected in the entry survey. This data will be separatedly stored from other data listed below. This data is only accessible by the project leader ans will not be disclosed to any third party. We will only use this data to contact you whenever necessary.

### The content you created inside the app

The content you created inside the app includes any text, recording, photos you upload and their derivations.
They will be stored securely at HKUST and will only be used for purposes of this study. The personal identifiers are stripped from them (i.e., the data is anonymized). They are accessible and only accessible by:
1. The researchers involved in this research project
2. Other participants of this study (only accessible through the app)

The results of this research may be presented at conferences or published in academic journals. For report purpose, a selected subset of the user-created content may be displayed to the public in academic papers as a part of the report. The researchers will *not* obtain additional approval from the users before adding their content to academic publications.
For demo purpose, a selected subset of the user-created content may be displayed to the public in other materials outside the academic publication venue, like demo videos/diagrams and advertisement of this research work. The researchers *will* obtain additional approval from the users before adding their content to such materials.

### "Other" data

"Other" data includes
* your demographic data (e.g., age, gender),
* your input from the entry survey questionnaire, the exit survey questionnaire, the interview (if opt in),
* the automatic logs of your app usage.

They will be stored securely at HKUST and will only be used for purposes of this study. The personal identifiers are stripped from them (i.e., the data is anonymized). The researchers involved in this research project will have access to them.

The results of this research may be presented at conferences or published in academic journals, but your identity and the data we collected from you will not be disclosed in any publication or presentation unless additional permission is acquired from you. The researchers will *not* obtain additional approval from the users before adding such data to academic publications.


## Risk and Discomfort

Participants may experience unexpected harassment or offend if some other participants do not follow the rules and post inappropriate content on the platform. The current application, as a prototype and proof-of-concept, does not have any content moderation. However, the researchers have zero tolerance with inappropriate content, and will help mitigating the discomform by
* listen and respond to participants' report of inappropriate content idenitified in this application
* delete confirmed inappropriate content
* if necessary, disqualify the participant that posts the confirmed inappropriate content
* if participants appeal to the university for investigation, coorperate the university in investigating the inappropriate content
