My surname, Huang (黄; 黃 in Traditional Chinese), is one of the most common surnames in China.
Apart from being a surname,
it also literally means *yellow* — now you know where my website domain comes.
My given name, Zeyu (泽宇; 澤宇 in Traditional Chinese),
is also a quite popular one.
That's also why any domain name as a combination of *huang* and *zeyu* is already taken.
*泽* originally means *the place where water gathers* (especially, pools, swamps, and magnificently large lakes).
Since water is such a pure and glistening thing and a necessity for life,
it also gains another meaning of *to bestow favor (to something)*.
*宇* means *the universe*.
Therefore, together, 泽宇 means to bestow favor and show kindness to the entirety of the world.

It is beautiful, isn't it?
