I am a game player, but not the most typical ones.
I love the experience of constant encounter with new stuff.
Therefore, I seldom play online games (too competitive) and AAA games (too complicated),
but I play a lot of indie puzzle and narrative games.

Story-oriented games like *What Remains of Edith Finch* and *The Stanley Parable* are something I'd definitely recommend.
For puzzle games, I want them to either come with delicate furnishings,
like *Gorogoa*, *Framed*, *The Witness*,
or be wrapped in adventures, like *Machinarium* (point-and-click),
*Fez* and *Portal* (platform),
or something new and eccentric like *Return of the Obra Dinn* and *Superliminal*.

Beyond the two main category, I am very similar to Videogamedunkey as a die-hard fan of Mario games, and I hate RPG and turn-based combat.
[As Videogamedunkey said](https://youtu.be/lG2dXobAXLI?si=x2fOH8yolH9eSs5t&t=71),
that (counter-)preference especially stands out when I say I *do* like *Undertale*, *Legend of Zelda*, and *Paper Mario*.
