If you ever know Mandarin Pinyin or understand Mandarin,
you must have been stunned by my one-in-a-million HKUST account name.
"zhuangbi" is the Mandarin Pinyin for "装逼" —
a slang meaning *to flaunt, to show off*.
But actually, it is intended to be "z" (for my given name "Zeyu"), "huang" (my surname), and a two-letter order code for all "zhuang"s since the first day of HKUST. Starting from "aa", "ab", and so on, I happen to get "bi". Not many of us HKUST students have to luck to be known by a catchy account name instead of the real name. And for the past four years of my undergraduate life, people have been (and beening loving) calling me by my account name.
