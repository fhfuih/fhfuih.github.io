My name is Huang Zeyu (<ruby>黄<rp>(</rp><rt>huāng</rt><rp>)</rp>
泽<rp>(</rp><rt>zé</rt><rp>)</rp>宇<rp>(</rp><rt>yǔ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>).
In Chinese, surname comes first.
So you can call me Zeyu.
I am currently a PhD student in CSE at the [HCI Lab](http://hci.cse.ust.hk) of [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk),
supervised by [Prof. MA, Xiaojuan](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~mxj/).

I am an [ENFJ](https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-personality) that never believes in [MBTI](https://www.16personalities.com) (which is probably why I'm [N](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant)).
I love music and playing drums.
I brew coffees and cook.
I check out exhibitions, shops, restaurants, streets, and the unexpected.
I drift off and wake, learn and forget.
