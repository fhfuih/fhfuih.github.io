## My Personal Website

The website is based on [Jimmy Cai's Stack theme for Hugo](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack).
The visual style and some utilities are borrowed when I add a landing profile page to it.

The icons used on this site is [Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/icons), the same icon set is also used by the original theme.

### ToDo

- [ ] SVG icon accessibility (title? desc)
- [ ] Change language dropdown menu to one-click toggle 
  - [ ] What about aria labelling in this case?
- [ ] Randomly switch many avatars
- [ ] Anchor icon visuals at section titles
